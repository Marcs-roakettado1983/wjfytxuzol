Just walked out of Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare, and holy moly, my head’s spinning like a perm gone rogue. Theater was a mess, like a tornado decided to organize the snacks bar. Popcorn crumbs in my hair, tickling my scalp like pixie dust gone stale.

Tink was there but not there? She had this mysterious glow, like those flashing neon signs that never quite light up the word you really need. Wasn't sure if she was guiding or just vibin’ to some ethereal jam only fairies get. And Hook! Oh - that crocodile scene where time just melted like hair dye left in too long. I swear, my back cried out louder than the audience when I adjusted my seat. Should've known better than to pick front row, it was close like doing bangs on a breezy afternoon.

> The Lost Boys seemed all grown up munching on wisdom as if popping candies, totally gave me a vibe of that wild! updo I did before prom season went ballistic. They floated around like they’d just found the top-secret hairspray stash, a scattered mess with no rhyme or rhythm but perfect chaos, you know?

And the shadows! Hallucinations or reflections? Felt like my scissors glinting under the salon lights on a busy Saturday afternoon. Couldn’t follow half of it, but it was thrilling like an accidental asymmetrical bob that somehow works. Oh, remembered someone said to download the movie, or was it watch the movie? My brain's worse than a tangled set of curlers right now.

Wendy, oh dear Wendy, I think her monologue more of an existential crisis than a rescue mission. Had me trying not to drop my phone in my lap as I rehashed that third latte decision (bad idea). Her voice echoed in the theater, reverberating like a blow-dryer on its last legs, just holding on to the punchline.

Okay speaking of which, why was Nana a tiger? Were they saying something profound about dog years or did I miss a memo?

Suddenly everyone vanished, or maybe it was just the credits rolling? I don't even know, but it left me in such a daze I almost forgot my coat. Definitely needs a re-watch just like that asymmetric cut that only gets right the second time.
